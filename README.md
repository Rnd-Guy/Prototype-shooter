# Prototype-shooter
A one-stage boss shooter where you upgrade your weapons by shooting at different parts of the boss.  
Created using visual studio 2015 and SFML 2.3.2. (http://www.sfml-dev.org/)  
(SFML library required to compile the game)

#####Controls:
Arrow keys to move  
Z key to shoot and select menu options  
A key to toggle autofire  
Escape to pause/unpause

#####Features:
A red/yellow/blue power bar system where you get stronger depending on which part of the boss you shoot!  
Higher red power lets you shoot more bullets,  
Higher yellow power lets you shoot more laser beams.  
(Blue power does not do anything right now).
